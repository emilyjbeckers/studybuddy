## Developing

I'm learning development as I go here.

`interactions.json` is a JSON file of the interaction model that can be uploaded to the skill dashboard by the person who owns it. The schema for this json file is described [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/interaction-model-schema.html).
